## üìò Design & Assumptions
- The project is built using **ASP.NET Core 8 Web API**.
- Data is stored temporarily using an **in-memory repository** (no database).
- The API follows standard **RESTful** structure with simple CRUD operations.
- **Swagger UI** is integrated for endpoint testing and documentation.
- The application is deployed to **Azure App Service**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Issues Encountered
- Swagger initially did not display in production ‚Äî fixed by enabling it globally.
- Azure redirection caused 404 at root ‚Äî resolved by setting `RoutePrefix = string.Empty` for Swagger.
